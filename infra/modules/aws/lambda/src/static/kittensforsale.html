<center>Let it be known that Jessica Johnson and her Cattery are in no way an affiliate of, partner to,<center>
<center>subsidiary, satellite, contributor, collaborator, associate, division, nor faction of CONGOCOON CATTERY!<br>
<center>Our cattery name and CFA number were fraudulently used by her to obtain CFA registration papers saying her kittens were Congocoons!<center><br>
<center>This matter is currently under investigation by CFA. We have filed a protest with CFA and intend to take the matter through legal channels.<center>
<center>We have worked too many years to develop our "Congocoon" type of Maine Coon, to have our name hijacked by an imposter!<center>
<br><center>If you purchased a kitten from her with Congocoons as the prefix, we urge you to demand a full refund, as you have been swindled!<center>
<center>Her kittens are not CongoCoons, resulting in diminished value! <center>
<center>You did NOT get what you payed for!<center>

<br><center>HOW DO I GET ON THE WAITING LIST?.. I KEEP MISSING OUT! <center>
<br>
<br>

<center>We often hear this, please read the info below! <center>

<br>
<center>Our heavy kitten season begins around April. In Winter and early Spring we have very few kittens to choose from.<center>  Later we should have two or three litters at one time, and of course, more variety of babies. <center>
<br>
<center>We do NOT keep a "Waiting List" <center>
<br>
<center>Once you see a kitten posted that you are interested in, Email Us! <center>
<center>We do not RESERVE kittens until they have been VET CHECKED! <center>
<center>Therefore we do not entertain inquiries on newborn babies. <center>
<center>If three people inquire on the same kitten, we will check back on emails to see who contacted us first. <center>




<br>

<center>People often email and then unfortunately miss out because they are uncertain if the kitten is the one for them. <center>
<center>We DO want our kittens to go into the "Perfect" home, but please be aware, that if you are wavering on reserving one, <center>
<center>someone else may be emailing me at the same time with an adamant "I WANT THAT KITTEN!" <center>

<BR><br>~~~ABOUT PRICE~~~<br>
<br>

<center><center>We do NOT sell kittens with breeding rights.<center>
<center>We do NOT sell kittens overseas, we will occasionally trade with an overseas breeder for outcross lines.<center>
<br>
<center>Kittens are sold as PETS ONLY, not to be shown or bred.<center>
<center>Kittens may be show quality, show potential, or may have a small fault which would disqualify them from showing.<center>
<center>If you are wanting to Show a kitten, then we would help you pick out a kitten that may do well at a show.<center>
<center>Things that may make a kitten not suitable for show could be, pattern not bright and clear, color not rich enough, <center>
<center>earset or profile off, short tail, tail kink (which can show up as late as 5 months old),<center> those awesome pouty pronounced whisker pads (not desired for show),or potential underbite etc.<center>
<center>Although these things would not be good for show, they have no bearing on a Super Pet!<center>
<br>
<center>Many people prefer the darker tabbys, as they look a bit wilder.  They may prefer a higher set ear,<center>
<center> or a smoke that isn't clearly breaking, although not good for show they have that AWESOME FERAL look!<center>
<center>A show kitten would be more moderate in type than we prefer at CongoCoons!<center>
<center>Although we prefer a wilder more feral type, we are currently breeding some fantastic show quality browns.<center> Sporting rich red and gold with brilliant clear patterns.<center>
<center>"Missing Link", "Primeval" and "Iron Maiden" are giving us some fantastic warm and boldly patterned offspring!<center><br>
<br>
<center>We have recently retired a number of adults, and are trying to not mix and dilute our colors.<center>
<center>We are working towards a strong Blue Silver, and a Warm Brown breeding program!<center>
<center>We have our new Odd Eyed Stud cat and will be working him into our program.<center>
<center>All kittens are born with blue eyes, which eventually turn green - green/gold or gold.<center> With solid white cats keeping a blue eye.  We hope to have solid colored cats with odd eyes in the future!<center>
<center>Note: If kittens are pictured at 5 weeks or so they may still show a blueish eye, this will change.<center>
<center> Often the eye goes through a copper color stage, don't get attached : )
 this will not stay.<center>
 
<br><br>
<br><br>
<center>Although we have had many Champion Cats, it has been years since we competed.<center>
<center>We have imported some Extreme Type cats recently, and will update our webpage shortly with their photos.<center>
<center>It is a constant work in progress to breed that SUPER CONGOCOON!<center>

<center>We want to offer a sincere 'Thankyou' to all who have joined our CongoCoon Family this past year,<center> and opened their home to one of our babies!<center>
<center>We have met some wonderful people and made many, many new friends in 2019.<center>
<center>We hope 2020 will be a good year, and look forward to producing some outstanding Maine Coons, Boboons, and Ghost Eyes!<center>
<br>
<br>
<br><br><br>
<center> Below is an update on the projects we have been undertaking through this winter.  <center>
<center>With new enclosures, a pheasant-peacock pen, pergolas added, along with extras, things look a bit different!<center>
<center>I want to give a huge hug and thankyou to my husband David for all his hard work in building everything.<center>
 <center>Not to mention placing all those stepping stones...jeesh, and mostly putting up with my input!<center>
<center>
<center>And another hug and thankyou to our dear friend Terry Owens for his help in the construction, and also putting up with my input!<center>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><center>OUR BABY KITTENS ARE BORN IN THE NURSERY IN OUR HOME<CENTER><BR>
<center>
<center>Kittens are using a litter box by five weeks of age, and have playpens in the Kitten Room adjacent to our den once they begin to toddle around.<center>
<center>When you come to get your kitten, he will be freshly groomed, and taken to the Cub Cabin for pick up.<center>
<center>Kittens are not housed in the Cub Cabin, it is for pick-up only.<center>
<br>
<center>Once you have RESERVED a kitten, you can rest assured no strangers will be handling your baby!<center>
<br>
<center> Kittens are wormed at 3 and 5 weeks of age, and are given their first innoculation at 6 weeks of age.  Kittens are vet checked at around 7 weeks of age.<center>  We give a 1 year health guarantee (death due to congenital defect) and an 8 week FIP guarantee. <center>No Registration Papers provided on pet kittens.<center>
<br><center>There are usually a number of adult cats available for viewing in the cattey garden, so you can see what your kitten may develop into!<center>
<br>
